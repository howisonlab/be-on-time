## **2/15 Meeting Summary:** 

Our first meeting was held at James's UTA offices, where we introduced ourselves and dived into the project details. The primary goal is to address the common issue of time management during meetings by creating a physical timer. This timer will provide a visual representation of the remaining time for each speaker.

**Hardware Exploration:** Following the initial meeting, we went to iSchool Technical Support and met Sam, was able to receive an Arduino kit. As someone with no prior knowledge of hardware and Arduino, this week was dedicated to exploring the kit's functionalities and potential applications.

**Weekly Schedule:** We have established a regular meeting schedule every Thursday at 11 in James's office to ensure consistent progress and communication.

**Upcoming Tasks:**

1.  **Arduino Mastery:** The focus for the next week involves studying Arduino to establish connections with the computer and exploring coding possibilities.
2.  **Prototype Development:** Concurrently, I will be working on low-fidelity prototypes for the visual timer, engaging in brainstorming and sketching activities.

**Collaboration Platform:** To streamline collaboration, a GitHub repository has been created. This repository will serve as a centralized hub for documenting milestones, posting work updates, and reflecting on the project's progress.

**Challenges:** The main challenge lies in overcoming my lack of prior knowledge in hardware and Arduino. However, with dedicated time and resources, I am confident in acquiring the necessary skills.

**Next Steps:**

1.  Continue Arduino exploration and coding practice.
2.  Develop low-fidelity prototypes for the visual timer.
3.  Regularly update the GitHub repository with progress and reflections.

**Conclusion:** The project is in its early stages, with a clear vision and plan outlined. Weekly meetings and a collaborative platform will ensure effective communication and progress tracking. As challenges arise, a proactive approach will be taken to address them and maintain momentum.
