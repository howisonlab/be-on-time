Agenda:

1.  LED Strip Programming Update

Discussion:

-   Successfully programmed LED strip with a 5-second/15-second loop.
-   Explored the capability to extend the loop duration; adjustments can be made for longer cycles.
-   Implemented gradual lighting up effect, enhancing the visual appeal of the LED strip.

Technical Details:

-   Concerns raised about the Arduino board's compatibility, as it supports a maximum of 5V. A solution might involve an external power source for the LED strip.
-   Differentiated between connecting to Arduino: 3 ports being more straightforward, while 4 ports may necessitate an external power adapter.

Action Items:

1.  Investigate and identify suitable external power adapters for the 12V LED strip. OR Elliot might have something- magnetic, individually addressable 5V led strip
    
2.  Test longer loop durations for the LED strip programming.
    
3.  Research alternative LED strips with 5V compatibility if needed.
    
4.  **Visit to Sera's Lab/ Elliott’s office**
    
    -   Action item: Schedule a visit to Sarah's lab to examine the paper hardboard and gather additional information.
    -   Explore the physical properties and potential use cases of the paper hardboard in Sera's lab.
    -   Arrange a meeting with Elliott to pick up some lego blocks, different LED strip
5.  **Magnets on a Strip:**
    
    -   Acknowledged as a good idea. Consider the practicality and functionality of using magnets on a strip for the project. But not sure how to describe it as a time chunk

**Magnet Dial for Time Setting:**

-   Discuss the idea of using a magnet on a strip as a dial for setting time parameters.

**Locate Magnets:**

-   Identify the physical location and availability of magnets. Confirm their compatibility with the project requirements.

Action Items:

-   Schedule a visit to Sera's lab and meeting with Elliott.
-   Explore magnet sensors, magnet types and descriptive language.
-   Investigate code libraries for LED time chunk
-   Look into similar projects for potential adaptation.
-   Object Replacement and Timeframe Detection - with timeframe detection
