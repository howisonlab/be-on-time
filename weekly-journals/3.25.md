# 3/25

user story: when the timer starts, we want users to have..

- set 60 seconds, wait for user input.
    - when user hits start button- starts countdown.
    - when user presses + button: time(sec) increases

So there should be 2 mode in arduino code: 1)countdown, 2) program the countdown.
1)Countdown: where it is, set the display.

2)Program mode: +: add 1 sec, -: distract 1 sec, start: go to countdown

- The **`delay(2000);`** function call was intended to keep the segment(number) on the display for 2 seconds. The actual implementation of displaying the segment(#) was not detailed but would involve setting specific segments of the display to on or off to form the pattern.
- **Outcome:** The display would show the segment (itâ€™s # 2 for this one) for 2 seconds before moving to the next step.

**Clearing the Display for 2 Seconds:**

- **Intended Action:** After showing the "#", the display was to be cleared or turned off for 2 seconds.
- **Method:** We utilized a **`delay(2000);`** function call again to hold the display clear for 2 seconds. The **`reset();`** function, though not implemented in the provided code snippet, was intended to clear the display.
- **Outcome:** The display would be blank for 2 seconds, providing a pause in the sequence.

**Waiting for a Button Press to Continue:**

- **Intended Action:** The sequence included a conditional pause, where the system would wait indefinitely until the user pressed a connected button to proceed.
- **Method:** This was to be achieved by a loop checking the state of **`button2`** using **`digitalRead(button2) == 1`**. The loop would only break when the button was pressed, indicating a digital high signal on the input pin connected to **`button2`**.
- **Outcome:** The system would wait for user interaction, making the sequence interactive and controlled by the user's pace

- The Arduino microcontroller executes code at a speed far exceeding what the human eye typically perceives as continuous motion or steady light. This rapid cycling through code, including the display updates, occurs so quickly that, when viewed directly, the display appears steady and unchanging during each intended display phase (e.g., showing the "#" symbol or being cleared).
- However, an interesting visual effect can be observed when not looking directly at the display. When focusing elsewhere and viewing the display peripherally ("with side eyes"), one might notice a slight flickering or "glitching" effect. This is not an actual glitch in the program or hardware but rather a perceptual artifact arising from the way our eyes and brain process light and motion. Peripheral vision is more sensitive to motion and changes in light intensity, which can make the rapid on/off cycling of the display segments perceptible as flickering when not viewed directly.
