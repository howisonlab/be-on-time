U-shaped conference room
The inner side of the U-shaped conference table measures approximately 1.5 meters. This dimension refers to the width of the desk area within the U shape, providing a compact and focused space for collaborative discussions and meetings. This setup is designed to facilitate a close and interactive environment, promoting effective communication among participants seated around the table.
planning to enhance our U-shaped conference table setup by installing a physical timer on the inner side, with the width of the desk area measuring approximately 1.5 meters
